Talend-Bonita6
==============

Talend Components to work with Bonita6

several components to
* login and logout to a Bonita6 server
* create and delete users

Everything is relatively untested for now

you will need to add the following libraries to your talend instalation:
* bonita-client-6.2.1.jar
* bonita-common-6.2.1.jar
* httpclient-4.2.5.jar
* commons-logging-1.1.1.jar
* httpcore-4.2.4.jar
* httpmime-4.2.5.jar
* xmlpull-1.1.3.1.jar
* xpp3_min-1.1.4c.jar
* xstream-1.4.2.jar

You may use different versions but you'll need to update the xml descriptors accordingly.
